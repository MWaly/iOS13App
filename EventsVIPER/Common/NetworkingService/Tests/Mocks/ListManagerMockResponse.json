        "description": "<p>All About Automated Testing in Flutter by MH Johnson, Software Engineer at Google</p> <p>Flutter is fast, but that doesn’t mean it’s just for prototyping. Proper testing is crucial for apps to scale. Luckily, Flutter has a powerful testing framework built in. We will explore Flutter’s testing framework by live coding a series of tests for an app, ranging from discrete widget tests to full integration tests using the Flutter driver.</p> <p>A New Jersey native, MH now lives in Chelsea and works at Google NYC. He started off at Google on an Ads product team doing front end web development in Angular Dart. He now works on the Material Design team for Flutter. Thanks to Flutter, MH was able to go from zero mobile dev experience to making both Android and iOS apps.</p> <p>CI as Smooth as Flutter by Mikhail Tokarev, Devops Engineer at Nevercode</p> <p>Let’s talk about out of the box CI solutions for your Flutter projects. Codemagic is a free dedicated CI/CD service for Flutter. It was announced during Flutter Live in December 2018 and has been growing and innovating ever since. Mikhail Tokarev will demonstrate how to set up and configure workflows in Codemagic for publishing your Flutter apps to the app store and play store. Tips and custom scripts that showcase how developers have been using Codemagic will also be covered and you will learn how to use different flavors in deployment.</p> <p>Mikhail has worked as devops engineer for over 5 years. He is passionate about introducing devops practices into the development process in different teams. He joined Nevercode over a year ago and now leads architecture design of both Nevercode and Codemagic. He first saw Flutter in 2018 after Droidcon in Berlin and is excited about helping mobile developers around the world with seamless CI/CD experiences.</p> <p>Food and drink will be provided by Google.</p> ",
